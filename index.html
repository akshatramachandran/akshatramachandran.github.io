											<h2>About</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Akshat Ramachandran is an EE major (2022) from Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, India. Akshat has diverse interests blurring the boundaries between computer science and electrical engineering. He hopes to make positive strides in designing faster and intelligent computer systems by unifying concepts from different areas of science and engineering based on his broad-based approach to learning.  
											<p>While pursuing his undergraduation, he has interned at Samsung Research and Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. At Samsung, he worked as a research intern in the AR Vision Lab developing Samsung's depth enhancement pipeline for improving 3D scene reconstruction for augmented reality applications.</p> </p>

										<p>
											Since August 2021, Akshat has been a research assistant at the VLSI Lab at IIT-B in Dr. Madhav Desai's group. Together with his colleagues, Akshat is working on building a high speed and secure networking platform on the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/jt376h9u">AJIT</a> microprocessor (the first ever microprocessor to be conceptualised, designed, developed and manufactured in India).

											<h2>Projects</h2>
										</header>
										<ul>
											<li><b style="color: violet">PositIV: A Configurable Posit Processor Architecture for Image and Video Processing</b></li>
											<p><img src="images/ExperimentalSetup.pdf" alt="" class="center" width="256" />Designed the first ever completely pipelined, configurable multi-core vision processor using <a href="https://posithub.org">posit arithmetic</a>. PositIV consumes 22–27% less power and 10–14% less silicon area over competing float-based architectures. The architecture automates multidimensional addressing, incorporates virtual image boundaries and prefetching for maximum overlap between processing and memory access. PositIV achieves 35–40% improvement in image processing quality and nearly 2x speedup over similar float-based architectures. Work done as part of undergraduate thesis titled (“ Next generation architecture for Computer Vision “).</p>

											<li><b style="color: violet">Industrial Safety Rapid Action Robot</b></li>
											<p><img src="images/fire_bot.png" alt="" class="center" width="256" />Built an autonomous robot that detects fires of classes A-D and even smoke-free fires using image processing and activates fire suppression system. Robot trained to detect fires by constructing maximum likelihood histograms from large corpus consisting of fire and non-fire images for each class of fire. Communicates with devices in fire suppression system using Zigbee. Robot can be monitored and controlled via mobile app. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XXjDGpfIVY"> View Robot Run</a>
											</p>

											<li><b style="color: violet">Multi Resolution Analysis Network (MRANet) and Disaster Management Application</b></li>
											<p><img src="images/Disaster Mgmt.png" alt="" class="center"  />Developed an end-to end disaster management application that aids in real-time and rapid disaster alleviation by assimilating remotely sensed images from multiple drones to identify severely damaged areas and buildings for triage by rescue services. Application incorporates a novel Multi Resolution Analysis Network (MRANet), for multi-class categorisation of post disaster satellite imagery. 
												Achieved a precision of 90.27 % <a href="https://github.com/ARamachandran2000/DisasterManagement"> View Source</a>

											<li><b style="color: violet">Sankatmochan Robot</b></li>
											<p><img src="images/eyantra robot.JPG" alt="" class="center"  />A redressal Bot developed on an Altera De0 Nano FPGA to identify potential dangers/threats in Industry 4.0.The robot traverses the factory floor and using its various sensors, actuators and networking devices, performs quick surveys of the floor and notifies accordingly. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyEhAdGl8VU"> View Robot Run</a>
											</p>

											<li><b style="color: violet">Color Normalisation of Histopathology Images</b></li>
											<p><img src="images/1_target.png" alt="" class="center"  />Staining and scanning of tissue samples for microscopic examination is fraught with undesirable color variations arising from differences in raw materials and manufacturing techniques. Proposed and implemented a novel color normalisation  technique using  multi-resolution neutrosophic sets to segment the individual stains in a tissue sample and perform landmark based color standardisation of each stain. Also implemented a fast color normalisation scheme utilising adaptive patch samples for WSI images in CUDA.
											</p>

											<li><b style="color: violet">Networking platform on the AJIT processor</b></li>
											<p><img src="images/ajit.pdf" alt="" class="center"  /> Working on building a reconfigurable, programmable, high-speed and secure networking platform centred around the AJIT Processor (Made in India) for military applications. Designed and verified a 40 Gb/s NIC + MAC configuration interfaced as a memory mapped peripheral to the AJIT processor on the VC709 FPGA for high-speed packet processing. Explored algorithmic design of hardware using AHIR, a high level synthesis toolchain.
